## Background



## Overview of Project

### Purpose

What knowledge do we hope to glean from running an unsupervised learning model on this dataset?
What data is available? What type? What is missing? What can be removed?
Is the data in a format that can be passed into an unsupervised learning model?
Can I quickly hand off this data for others to use?


## Analysis And Challenges

## Methodology: Analytics Paradigm

#### 1. Decomposing the Ask

* Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
